To fulfill the ancient prophecy, you must bring me to the end of this terrible place. 
Be careful though.
Monsters are lurking around every corner. 
Be sure to shine your flashlight on them to temporarily disable them. 
Yes..temporarily. How can you kill that which is already dead!?
Left click or press the north button on your game pad to shine your light, but be careful.
Your flashlight can run out of battery. In that case, be sure to run and hide so it can charge. 
Enough chit chat. Lets go!
